The Rubber Duck Debugging Method

Rubber duck debugging is a method of debugging code by explaining it to an inanimate object, such as a rubber duck. The name comes from a story in the book "The Pragmatic Programmer" where a programmer would carry around a rubber duck and debug their code by explaining it line-by-line to the duck.

How it works:
1. Get a rubber duck (or any inanimate object)
2. Explain your code to the duck line by line
3. While explaining, you'll often realize where the problem is

Benefits:
- Forces you to explain your code step by step
- Helps identify assumptions and logical errors
- Can be done without bothering colleagues
- Often leads to "aha!" moments

Remember: The duck is very patient and won't judge your code!
