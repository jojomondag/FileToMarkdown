The Debugging Duck
=================
A Tale of Rubber and Reason
--------------------------

Dear Diary,

Today my rubber duck saved my sanity again. There I was, staring at my screen for three hours, wondering why my perfectly written code wasn't working. The bug was driving me quackers!

My Debugging Process:
* Stared at screen (2 hours)
* Drank coffee (4 cups)
* Pulled hair (mostly still intact)
* Questioned career choices (twice)

Then I remembered my faithful companion, Professor Quackington III, sitting quietly on my desk. As soon as I started explaining my "perfect" code to him, his judgemental plastic eyes made me realize:

    function calculateTotal(items) {
        let total == 0;  // The professor's eyes narrowed at this line
        items.forEach(item => {
            total += item.price;
        });
        return total;
    }

The professor just sat there, giving me that look. You know the one - that "you used == instead of = and you call yourself a programmer?" look that only rubber ducks can give.

Debugging Timeline:
1. Explained code to duck
2. Duck stared judgmentally
3. Found embarrassing bug
4. Questioned duck's smugness level

    // Fixed code after duck intervention
    function calculateTotal(items) {
        let total = 0;  // Professor Quackington approved
        items.forEach(item => {
            total += item.price;
        });
        return total;
    }

Final Thoughts:
* The duck was right (again)
* My ego is slightly bruised
* Coffee supplies need replenishing
* Professor Quackington III deserves a promotion

Note to self: Maybe it's time to start a support group - "Developers Anonymous: When Your Rubber Duck Is Smarter Than You."

Sincerely,
A Humbled Developer

P.S. The duck is still judging me.
