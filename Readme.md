FileToMarkdown
==============

This is a tool to convert a file to markdown.

Why? Because if all files comes into the same format, we can use the same tool to process them. What is this universal format you say? Its ofcourse the least viable delimiter, known as text. What is MD in its core? Its just a text file with a .md extension. There are tools out there for this purpose, but the goal with this tool is to have this functionality contained within a NPM package ready to use from NPM install. The core of the program will be inoput a file and output a markdown file. The processing aka conversion of the file is handled within FileToMarkdown.js.
